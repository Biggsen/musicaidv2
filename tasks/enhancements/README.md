# Enhancements

This folder contains future enhancements that are not essential for the core functionality but would improve the user experience.

## Purpose

These enhancements are documented for future implementation when:
- The core features are stable and working well
- User feedback indicates these features would be valuable
- There's time/budget for additional polish

## Current Enhancements

### 01-realtime-collaboration.md
Real-time updates and live collaboration features. Currently deferred because manual refresh is sufficient for the workflow.

## Adding New Enhancements

When identifying a feature that's "nice-to-have" but not essential:
1. Create a new markdown file in this folder
2. Number them sequentially (01-, 02-, etc.)
3. Document the feature, use cases, and implementation approach
4. Reference it from the main task file if it was originally planned there
