# Ideas

This folder contains feature ideas that have been discussed but not yet fully scoped or prioritized for implementation.

## Purpose

These are exploratory ideas that:
- Sound promising but need more research/planning
- Are feature requests that came up during development
- Could enhance the workflow but require more design consideration
- May or may not be implemented depending on user needs

## Current Ideas

### 01-review-with-timestamped-notes.md
A review workflow step type that allows creating timestamped notes while listening to audio tracks.

## Adding New Ideas

When a new feature idea comes up:
1. Create a new markdown file in this folder
2. Number them sequentially (01-, 02-, etc.)
3. Document the idea, use cases, and initial implementation thoughts
4. Keep it flexible - these can evolve before implementation
